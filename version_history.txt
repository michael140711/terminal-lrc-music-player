3.10.3 9/3/2025 12:14 PM
 - fixed a major bug (issue #20) where lrc-player would have lyric run faster than the audio, especially when
   there are longer lyrics needed to parse.
   Now it would re-adjust the time after everything is loaded properly.

3.10.2
 - update player.py with more menu option, now playlist function is available!!
 - update player.py with more menu option, where it can run it directly or run it shuffle.

3.10.1
 - Removed a set a minimun/max for timestamp duration.
 - Update the L factor (max) to 5 seconds
 - Add lyrics matches for incompleted matches: like (feat. xxx) could be shown in lyrics or song names. Now it would reconized it

3.10.0 8/29/2025 8:48 AM
 Player.py updates
 Major Update to player.py
 - update more menu option and settings page
 - update so it would actually call lrc-player.py
 - added shuffle option
 - add support for bluetooth audio delay tag.
 and a couple minot bug fix

3.9.5 8/28/2025 3:40 PM
 Finally fixed the highlighting logic- after tried a couple different version, then realized that bluetooth could be the one causing
 delays and everything.

 - Now it will highlight a character at 15% (can be configured) in between the timestamps
 - Now it will read a bluetooth audio delay in cfg file (player.py will be updated in next branch for this feature)
 - Fixed an issue where there is a fixed time for highlighting delay. We don't want make delays just because it seems unnatural,
  we want to fix the problem instead.

 Seeking Fix - there are some seeking fix that shouldn't be in this branch however fixed in this branch.
 - fixed an issue where multiple threading happening when automatically ends a song and goes to next song
 - fixed an issue where sometime seeking would jump to next song due to pygame's audio limitation, where getBusy() would return
  false when during seeking,which in this case seeking is just stop the audio then replays it at certain timestamp. This would
  cause system thinking song ends occasionally during seeking.


3.9.0 8/22/2025 4:00 PM
 version bump because I realized the lyric is not fully sync up partially because there is an audio delay using bluetooth

 - Added logic for cfg.playlist file (player-temp.cfg) and added a tag for audio offset for bluetooth
 - Added logic for player read the offset and take into the offset during animation.


3.8.4
 fixed an issue where multiple threads would show up if audio ends naturally.
 fixed an issue where jumping would randomly happen during seeking using [‚Üê/‚Üí] button

 Tried 4th version of displaying/animation logic, which would use a ratio to calculate when a character changes color.


3.8.1 8/20/2025 5:01 PM
 fixed an issue where animation would highlight the word during the middle time.
 we want to start changing color right after the beginning time start-
	since console can't animate half a character.

 This fixed a bug where Chinese/Korean/Japanese type lyrics has a significant delay,
 	since their word is one character, not in letters.

3.7.0 8/20/2025 10:51 AM
update mulitple lyrics support using V. bumping version to 3.7.0


3.6.5
more seeking fex

3.6.4 8/19/2025 11:12 am
 merged with seeking fix - seeking fix at version 3.5.4. Seeking is now fixed.

3.6.0 8/19/2025 9:31 AM
 word-by-word duration is way to long for some of the words or the lyrics file itself that has incorrect timestamps.
 added a calculated curve which set the max (L) to 2 second, and the curve value to 0.95.
 This would shrink much more when the duration is much higher, using a non-linear calculation.

3.5.2 8/18/2025 5:19 PM
 fixed animation from fixed time to lyrics.


lrc-player3.5.1 8/18/2025 10:26 AM
Added seek support- it's a bit buggy where tapping mulitple times can cause it to crash or to next song.
Updated the time to 2 decimal places for easier lyc file for word-by-word time/lyrics fixing.
