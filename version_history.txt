3.8.1 8/20/2025 5:01 PM
 fixed an issue where animation would highlight the word during the middle time.
 we want to start changing color right after the beginning time start-
	since console can't animate half a character.

 This fixed a bug where Chinese/Korean/Japanese type lyrics has a significant delay,
 	since their word is one character, not in letters.

3.6.0 8/19/2025 9:31 AM
 word-by-word duration is way to long for some of the words or the lyrics file itself that has incorrect timestamps.
 added a calculated curve which set the max (L) to 2 second, and the curve value to 0.95.
 This would shrink much more when the duration is much higher, using a non-linear calculation.

3.5.2 8/18/2025 5:19 PM
 fixed animation from fixed time to lyrics.

Added seek support- it's a bit buggy where tapping mulitple times can cause it to crash or to next song.
Updated the time to 2 decimal places for easier lyc file for word-by-word time/lyrics fixing.
