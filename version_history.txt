 word-by-word duration is way to long for some of the words or the lyrics file itself that has incorrect timestamps.
 added a calculated curve which set the max (L) to 1 second, and the curve value to 0.95.
 This would shrink much more when the duration is much higher, using a non-linear calculation.

Added seek support- it's a bit buggy where tapping mulitple times can cause it to crash or to next song.
Updated the time to 2 decimal places for easier lyc file for word-by-word time/lyrics fixing.
