3.9.0 8/22/2025 4:00 PM
 version bump because I realized the lyric is not fully sync up partially because there is an audio delay using bluetooth

 - Added logic for cfg.playlist file (player-temp.cfg) and added a tag for audio offset for bluetooth
 - Added logic for player read the offset and take into the offset during animation.

3.8.4
 fixed an issue where multiple threads would show up if audio ends naturally.
 fixed an issue where jumping would randomly happen during seeking using [←/→] button

 Tried 4th version of displaying/animation logic, which would use a ratio to calculate when a character changes color.

3.8.1 8/20/2025 5:01 PM
 fixed an issue where animation would highlight the word during the middle time.
 we want to start changing color right after the beginning time start-
	since console can't animate half a character.

 This fixed a bug where Chinese/Korean/Japanese type lyrics has a significant delay,
 	since their word is one character, not in letters.

more seeking fex

3.6.0 8/19/2025 9:31 AM
 word-by-word duration is way to long for some of the words or the lyrics file itself that has incorrect timestamps.
 added a calculated curve which set the max (L) to 2 second, and the curve value to 0.95.
 This would shrink much more when the duration is much higher, using a non-linear calculation.

3.5.2 8/18/2025 5:19 PM
 fixed animation from fixed time to lyrics.


lrc-player3.5.1 8/18/2025 10:26 AM
Added seek support- it's a bit buggy where tapping mulitple times can cause it to crash or to next song.
Updated the time to 2 decimal places for easier lyc file for word-by-word time/lyrics fixing.
